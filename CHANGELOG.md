## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **🚨 CRITICAL SERVER HANG FIX**: Server now responds immediately without blocking on cache initialization
  - **Root Cause**: MappingService blocked on cache initialization, causing indefinite hangs and rate limiting
  - **Solution**: Non-blocking cache initialization - server responds immediately while cache loads in background
  - **Impact**: Fixes "spinning result" hang and API rate limit errors reported by users
  - **Concurrency Protection**: Added locks to prevent parallel cache refreshes that were causing hundreds of simultaneous API calls
- **CRITICAL RATE LIMITING PROTECTION**: Limited enhancement to 10 items max to prevent API abuse
  - **Root Cause**: Enhancement was trying to map ALL 500 results instead of requested 5, causing excessive API calls
  - **Solution**: Limit enhancement to first 10 items only, disable fallback lookups
  - **Impact**: Prevents rate limiting errors and reduces API load by 98%
- **🚨 CRITICAL DATA ACCURACY FIX**: Implemented pagination-by-default to eliminate massive ticket undercounts
  - **Root Cause**: Default page size was limited to 25-50 tickets, causing severe data accuracy issues
  - **Solution**: All search tools now paginate through ALL results by default for complete datasets
  - **Impact**: Fixes undercounting from 26 tickets to actual counts (e.g., 97+ tickets)
  - **User Control**: Only specify `pageSize` parameter when you actually want to limit results
- **CRITICAL: Massive Ticket Undercount**: Fixed automatic company filter that was severely limiting ticket search results (was showing only ~10 tickets instead of 97+)
- **Critical Unassigned Ticket Search Issue**: Fixed inability to search for unassigned tickets that was causing discrepancies between UI and API results
- **Parameter Mapping Issue**: Fixed `companyID` to `companyId` parameter mapping in `search_tickets` tool handler
- Enhanced ticket filtering logic to properly handle all filter parameters including assignment status

### Changed
- **Default Behavior**: `search_tickets` and all search tools now return complete datasets via automatic pagination
- **Performance**: Increased page size to 500 tickets per API request for efficiency while paginating
- **Safety**: Added pagination safety limit of 100 pages (50,000 tickets) to prevent infinite loops
- **Tool Descriptions**: Updated all search tool descriptions to clarify pagination-by-default behavior
- **Status Filtering**: Improved open ticket definition (status < 5) for accurate filtering

### Added
- **Data Accuracy Guarantee**: All search operations now provide complete, paginated results by default
- **Enhanced ID-to-Name Mapping**: Comprehensive mapping service with intelligent caching
  - New tools: `get_company_name`, `get_resource_name`, `get_mapping_cache_stats`, `clear_mapping_cache`, `preload_mapping_cache`
  - Automatic enhancement of search results with `_enhanced` field containing resolved names
  - 30-minute cache expiry with graceful fallback for missing data
- **Pagination Testing**: Added test scripts to verify complete data retrieval (`npm run test:pagination`)
- **Unassigned Ticket Support**: Added `unassigned` boolean parameter to `search_tickets` tool to search for tickets without assigned resources
- **Enhanced Tool Handler**: `EnhancedAutotaskToolHandler` with automatic ID-to-name resolution

### Fixed (Additional)
- **CRITICAL: Incomplete Company/Resource Mapping**: Fixed mapping cache that was limited to 500 records, causing "Customer 624" style names instead of proper company names
- **All Search Methods Now Complete**: Applied pagination-by-default to `searchCompanies`, `searchContacts`, and `searchResources` to ensure mapping cache includes ALL entities
- **Graceful Mapping Fallback**: Enhanced mapping service to not throw errors on cache failures, allowing direct API lookups as fallback

## [1.1.1] - 2025-06-10

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Resolved "result exceeds maximum length" errors in ticket searches by implementing aggressive data optimization
- Limited ticket search results to maximum 3 tickets per query to stay under 1MB MCP response limit
- Reduced ticket data from 76 fields (~2KB per ticket) to 18 essential fields (~685 characters per ticket)
- Added service-level result limiting as safety measure since Autotask API may ignore pageSize parameter
- Improved null handling in ticket data optimization to prevent runtime errors

### Changed
- Updated `search_tickets` tool description to clarify field limitations and recommend `get_ticket_details` for full data
- Reduced maximum pageSize for ticket searches from 100 to 3 due to API response size constraints
- Enhanced ticket data truncation with clear indicators to use `get_ticket_details` for full content
